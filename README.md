# Local Docker Usage

This list summarises how I use Docker locally for short-living tasks..

1. Set up a database locally for my development work; they are usually reset
   around every fortnight.
1. Do some experimental work in Ubuntu/Alpine; they are removed instantly after
   the job is done, probably within minutes after creation.
1. Automate more complex tasks but they are not stable enough to be in a
   published image.
